/**
 * Standard event types emitted from Compact contracts via the `emit` expression.
 *
 * Events flow from contract emission → ledger wrapping → indexer storage → DApp queries.
 *
 * @remarks
 * - **Event Version**: Phase 1 wire format (version 1). Bumped when on-chain
 *   VersionedLogItem layout or per-event payload format changes.
 * - **Event Size**: Bounded and enforced on-chain by the ledger/VM. Per MIP-0002 an oversized
 *   event is dropped (degraded) rather than causing a failure, so no size limit is enforced here.
 * - **Standard Events**: Fixed schemas for token operations and lifecycle events
 *   - `ShieldedSpend`, `ShieldedReceive`, `ShieldedMint`, `ShieldedBurn`
 *     (indexed fields: `nullifier`, `commitment`)
 *   - `UnshieldedSpend`, `UnshieldedReceive`, `UnshieldedMint`, `UnshieldedBurn`
 *     (indexed fields: `sender`, `domainSep`, `tokenType`)
 *   - `Paused`, `Unpaused` (lifecycle events, empty payload)
 * - **Custom Events**: Use `Misc` type for contract-specific data with
 *   `name` and `payload` fields
 * - **Non-Consensus**: Events are NOT consensus state; indexer controls retention
